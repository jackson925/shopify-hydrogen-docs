### Enterprise Systems and Processes: Bridging the Gap

#### Development Cycle Framework

Implementing enterprise-grade development processes creates predictability and transparency for non-technical stakeholders:

##### 1. Stage-Gated Development Approach

A transparent, milestone-based approach makes the development process accessible to non-technical owners:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│  Discovery   │────►│   Definition  │────►│ Development    │
│  Workshop    │     │   Blueprint   │     │ Sprints        │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └────────────────┘
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│  Continuous  │◄────┤    Launch    │◄────┤  Validation    │
│  Improvement │     │    Program   │     │  Checkpoint    │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └────────────────┘
```

**Key Merchant Touchpoints**:
- **Discovery Workshop**: Collaborative session that translates business goals into technical requirements
