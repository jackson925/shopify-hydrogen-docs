# About This Documentation System

This documentation site is built using Jekyll with the Just the Docs theme, providing a centralized and consistent way to view all documents related to the Shopify Hydrogen Migration Partnership.

## How It Works

1. **Markdown Rendering**: All content is written in Markdown format (.md files) and automatically rendered as HTML by GitHub Pages.
   
2. **Consistent Navigation**: The sidebar navigation provides easy access to all documents, organized by category.
   
3. **Search Functionality**: The built-in search makes it easy to find specific information across all documents.
   
4. **Proper Formatting**: All documents maintain consistent styling and formatting, making them easier to read.
