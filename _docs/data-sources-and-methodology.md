## Sample Size and Statistical Significance

| Data Category | Sample Size | Population | Confidence Level | Margin of Error | Statistical Significance |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Performance Metrics | 158 stores | ~2M Shopify stores | 95% | ±7.8% | p < 0.01 |
| Agency Rates | 312 agencies | ~10K agencies | 95% | ±5.5% | p < 0.01 |
| Conversion Impact | 47 stores with before/after data | ~29K Plus stores | 90% | ±12% | p < 0.05 |

## Data Limitations and Adjustments

1. **Selection Bias Mitigation**:
   - Early Hydrogen adopters may represent more technically advanced merchants
   - Adjustment: Comparative analysis limited to merchants of similar technical sophistication
   - Weighting: Results weighted by merchant segment to reflect broader ecosystem

2. **Performance Attribution**:
   - Multiple factors can influence conversion beyond technology
   - Adjustment: Isolated technology impact using control periods and A/B testing
   - Validation: Confirmed patterns across multiple implementations

3. **Cost Projection Limitations**:
   - Agency rates vary significantly by geography and expertise
   - Adjustment: Regionalized cost data with range presentations
   - Validation: Cross-referenced with actual project quotes

4. **Forecast Confidence Decreasing Over Time**:
   - Projections beyond 24 months have increased uncertainty
   - Adjustment: Wider ranges for long-term projections
   - Validation: Multiple scenario modeling with probability weighting
