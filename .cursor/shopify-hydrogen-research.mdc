5. All diagrams and visualizations must include text descriptions for accessibility.
6. Citations must follow a consistent format with accessible references.
7. Navigation structure must follow the established hierarchy from executive overview to technical implementation.

### Content Requirements

1. Executive documents must prioritize business outcomes over technical details.
2. Technical documentation must include specific implementation approaches with examples.
3. All performance claims must cite specific metrics with testing methodology.
4. Cost analysis must include ranges rather than specific figures when appropriate.

6. All documents must maintain a professional, objective tone throughout.
7. Implementation guidance must be practical and acknowledge potential challenges.

### Data Integrity Rules

1. All market sizing must be based on verifiable Shopify ecosystem data.
2. Performance metrics must specify testing methodology and conditions.
3. ROI calculations must include all relevant cost factors and timeframes.
4. Source citations must be current (within last 2 years where possible).
5. Competitive analysis must fairly represent alternatives without bias.
6. Customer impact metrics must distinguish between correlation and causation.
7. Business projections must include multiple scenarios with probability assessments.

### Research Boundaries

1. Focus on established Shopify merchants with existing Liquid stores.
2. Include only publicly disclosed information about Shopify's roadmap.
3. Limit technology comparisons to relevant e-commerce frameworks.
4. Exclude pricing details that may fluctuate or vary by region.
5. Avoid making claims about specific third-party integrations without evidence.
6. Maintain focus on the migration journey rather than initial implementation.
7. Consider enterprise, mid-market, and high-growth merchant segments.

### Visualization Guidelines

1. All charts must include proper titles, legends, and axis labels.
2. Maintain consistent color schemes across all visualizations.
3. Use appropriate chart types for different data relationships.
4. Include data sources and sample sizes for all visualizations.
5. Ensure all visualizations are intelligible in both color and grayscale.
6. Provide raw data tables alongside complex visualizations.
7. Use consistent scales and units across related visualizations.

### Navigation Structure

1. Maintain logical document flow from strategic to tactical information.
2. Group related documents in clear categories.
3. Ensure consistent cross-referencing between related documents.
4. Provide navigational aids for different stakeholder journeys.
5. Maintain consistent depth of information within each document category.
6. Ensure search-friendly document titles and headings.
7. Include a clear entry point document for each audience type.

### Quality Control Requirements

1. All documents must undergo technical accuracy review.
2. Financial projections must be validated against established benchmarks.
3. Case studies must be fact-checked with verifiable outcomes.
4. All claims must be supported by at least two independent sources where possible.
5. Technical recommendations must be validated against current best practices.
6. All content must be reviewed for clarity and comprehensibility.
7. Documents must be free of contradictory information across the research.

### Content Exclusions

1. Specific merchant names without public case studies or permission.
2. Proprietary implementation details not publicly disclosed.
3. Developer skills assessment of specific agencies or teams.
4. Speculative features not confirmed by Shopify.
5. Guarantees of specific performance improvements without caveats.
6. Internal Shopify roadmap information not publicly available.
7. Specific pricing of implementation services.

### Document Maintenance

1. Performance metrics should be updated quarterly.
2. Market sizing should be re-validated annually.
3. Case studies should be added as new implementations are completed.
4. Technology comparisons should be updated with major Shopify releases.
5. Financial models should be adjusted annually for market conditions.
6. References should be reviewed bi-annually for currency.
7. Navigation structure should be reassessed with significant content additions.
